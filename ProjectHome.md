Our framework aims to simplify the integration of independently developed NLP tools, while providing an easy-to-use programming environment, and transparent handling of distributed computing problems, such as fault tolerance and task scheduling, when executing the NLP tools in parallel. Moreover, NLP systems built on top of the framework should are language-independent and produce layered annotations.
